> Unnecesary Complex Angular Application

This project is deliberately crafted with an overengineering approach to challenge conventional limits and enhance the integration of a wide array of solutions, libraries, and architectural patterns. Its primary aim is to simplify the process of executing highly complex projects by leveraging the _Angular_ framework. A deep-rooted commitment exists within the project to relentlessly pursue and incorporate the most groundbreaking solutions provided by the framework and its ancillary projects. This ensures that every unique requirement or use case is met with the most efficient and avant-garde strategy available, showcasing a blend of innovation and technical prowess.

Operating under an [MIT](https://github.com/RicardoJBarriosEviden/uncoanap/blob/main/LICENSE) license, the project does not aim to produce a supported and distributable end product. The focus is rather on the creation and deployment of artifacts in diverse environments, allowing for the thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of various solutions under examination. The choice of _Pathfinder® First Edition_ role-playing game rules as a foundation serves a dual purpose: it provides a neutral, stable, richly documented, and complex base for use case definition and resolution, while also complying with the [Open Game License Version 1.0a](https://paizo.com/pathfinder/compatibility/ogl) and the [Paizo Inc. Pathfinder® Roleplaying Game
Compatibility License](https://paizo.com/pathfinder/compatibility/first). 
By carefully aligning with these open licenses, the project strategically avoids potential legal issues, ensuring compliance and fostering a safe environment for innovation. This careful consideration of legal compliance serves as a cornerstone for the project, allowing it to pursue ambitious goals without the risk of infringing on intellectual property rights or encountering other legal obstacles.
